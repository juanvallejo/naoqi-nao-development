naoqi-nao-development
=====================

Development journal for nao robots (with Dr. Flores). This project aims to learn and implement as much of the NAOqi SDK as possible.

### Modules list

The following, are `C++` modules that have been completed by the team so far.

- `hello`
- `face`
- `video` (work in progress)

### Setting Up Workspace

This repo comes with a few `C++` modules, `hello` and `face` are two of them. To get started, make sure you have `naoqi-sdk-2.1.2.17` installed, and your `qitoolchain` is configured to use it.

- Make sure you have `qibuild` and `qisrc` installed. Clone this repository, and `cd` into it.

- Then, link all dependencies to the module by typing `qibuild configure <module_name>`
- Finally, build the module by typing `qibuild make <module_name>`

A detailed guide on setting up your work environment, and builing modules from scratch will be posted in the `docs` soon.

### Adding Modules

You must add these modules to your workspace before you can build and run them.

- To add modules (that should already be present in your current folder) to the `worktree`, type:
 
```
qisrc add <module_name>
```

### Building Modules

To build a specific module, make sure it's been added to your worktree. Then link its dependencies:

```
qibuild configure <module_name>
```

And run `make` on it:

```
qibuild make <module_name>
```

### Running Modules

To run a module, simply type:
```
qibuild run <module_name>
```

Please note that if the module is a remote module (pretty much all of them are), you will need to pass arguments to it when running it, specifying the **IP address** of the robot. To do so, run it by typing:

```
qibuild run <module_name> -- --pip <IP_ADDRESS>
``` 

**Make note of the double dashes** before the first argument. These *escape* the rest of the dashes before each flag.
